Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable to store string.

Step 3: Input a string from use.

Step 4: Define a variable flag and set it to true.

Step 5: Convert the string to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Step 6: Now, iterate through the string forward and backward.

Step 7: Compare one character at a time till middle of the string is reached.

Step 8: If any of the character doesn't match, 

Step 9: Set the flag to false and break the loop.

Step 10: At the end of the loop, if flag is true, 

Step 11: It Print string is a palindrome.

Step 12: If flag is false, 

Step 13: Print string is not a palindrome.

Step 14: Stop.
