Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare and initialize four variables as row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end.

Step 3: Input the values from user.

Step 4: Run a loop until all the elements are printed.

Step 5: Print the top row from the col_start to the col_end

Step 6: Increment the value of row_start to shift the boundary

Step 7: Print the right column from row_start to row_end and reduce the  dimension of the left boundary.
  
Step 8: Print the end row from col_start to col_end and again reduce the boundary   dimension by decrementing the value of row_end.

Step 9: Print the start column from row_end to row_start and increment the value of col_start.

Step 10: Print the result

Step 11: Stop
