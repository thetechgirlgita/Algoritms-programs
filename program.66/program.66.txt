Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable for storing string.

Step 3: Input a string from user.

Step 4: Two loops will be used to find the duplicate characters.

Step 5: Outer loop will be used to select a character and initialize variable count by 1.

Step 6: Inner loop will compare the selected character with rest of the characters present in the string.

Step 7: If a match found, it increases the count by 1 

Step 8: Set the duplicates of selected character by '0' to mark them as visited.

Step 9: In inner loop, if count of character is greater than 1, then it has duplicates in the string.

Step 10: Print duplicated strings.

Step 11: Stop
