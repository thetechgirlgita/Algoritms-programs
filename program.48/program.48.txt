Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create variables "a" for first number, "d" for common difference, "n" for           total number

Step 3: Declare sum = 0 and tn 

Step 4: Take input for "a", "n" and "d" from users and store it.

Step 5: Now assign sum = (n * (2 * a + (n - 1) * d)) / 2

Step 6: Also assign tn = a + (n - 1) * d

Step 7: Now use for loop for processings  (i = a; i <= tn; i = i + d)

Step 8: If i != tn

Step 8.1:  Print the value of i and + 
        
     8.2:  Else
        
     8.3:  Print i = sum.
        
Step 9:  Stop
