Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare two variable i and j

Step 3: Do length (string)-1, to set J at last position

Step 4: Do string [0], to set i on the first character.

Step 5: String [i] is interchanged with string[j]
 
Step 6: Increment i by 1

Step 7: Increment j by 1

Step 8: if i>j then go to step3

Step 9: Print the reversed value

Step 10: Stop
