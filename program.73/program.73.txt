Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variables to store strings 's1', 's2'.

Step 3: Input the strings from user.

Step 4: First check the length of s1 nd s2 

Step 5: If both are  not equal in length goto step 11.

Step 6: If length is equal then

Step 7: Declare a variable called temp.

Step 8: Store the concatenation of s1 with s1 itself in variable temp.

Step 9: If s2 is a substring of temp then

Step 10: Print s1 and s2 are rotations of each other

Step 11: Stop
