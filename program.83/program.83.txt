Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable to store an string

Step 3: Take input  from user

Step 4: Declare an array freq with the same size as that of string. 

Step 5: Declare variable minChar and maxChar and initialized them to first character present in the string.

Step 6: Assign outer loop to select a character and initialize  corresponding index in freq with 1.

Step 7: Assign Inner loop to compare the selected character with rest of characters

Step 8: If a match found, then increment the freq[i] by 1.

Step 9: Declare variable min and max  to store the count of minimum and  maximum occurring character.

Step 10: Loop through the array freq and compare count of each character stored in freq with min and max.

Step 11: If count stored in freq is less than value of min

Step 12: Store that count in min and corresponding character in minChar.

Step 13: If count stored in freq is more than value of max, 

Step 14: Store that count in max and corresponding character in maxChar.

Step 15: Display minChar as minimum occurring character and maxChar as 	 maximum occurring character.

Step 16: Stop
