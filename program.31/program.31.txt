Step 1: Start

Step 2: Input the octal number.

Step 3: Count the total number of digits in the given number.

Step 4: Assume that the number has n digits.

Step 5: Multiply each digit in the number with 8^(n-1), when the digit is in the nth position.

Step 6: Perform addition of all the digits after multiplication.
 
Step 7: The added sum gives the decimal equivalent of the octal number.
 
Step 8: Divide the decimal number by 2 and store the remainder in array

Step 9: Divide the quotient by 2

Step 10: Repeat the step 9, until we get quotient equal to zero

Step 11: Print the array in reverse order.

Step 12: Stop
