Step 1: Start

Step 2: Take input for first polynomial and second polynomial

Step 3:  while p and q are not null, repeat step 4.

Step 4:  If powers of the two terms are equal then

     4.1: if the terms do not cancel then insert the sum of the terms into the sum Polynomial
     4.2: Advance p
     4.3: Advance q
     4.4: Else if the power of the first polynomial> power of second
     4.5: Then insert the term from first polynomial into sum polynomial
     4.6: Advance p
     4.7: Else insert the term from second polynomial into sum polynomial
     4.8: Advance q
     
Step 5: copy the remaining terms from the non empty polynomial into the
        sum polynomial.
        
Step 6: Stop.
        
  #Note :  The fifth step of the algorithm is to be processed till the end of the polynomials                has not been reached.
