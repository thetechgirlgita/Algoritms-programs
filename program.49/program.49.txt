 Step 1: Start
 
 Step 2: Input the number. 
 
 Step 3: Counts the digits present in a number in calculateLength()
     3.1: Use a while loop to check whether the number is not equal to 0.
     3.2: Divide the number by 10 and increment the variable length by 1.
     3.3: Return length.
     
 Step 4: Define and initialize variable num.
 
 Step 5: Make a copy of num by storing the value of num in n.
 
 Step 6: Using while loop calculates remainder rem repeatedly by dividing num with 10. 
 
 Step 7: Calculate the value of rem raised to power its position, i.e. remlen and store            the computed value in a variable sum.
 
 Step 8: Check whether sum is equal to number.
 
 Step 9: If yes, then given number is Disarium number.
 
 Step 10: Else, it is not a Disarium number.
 
 Step 11: Stop
