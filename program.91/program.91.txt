Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable to store array.

Step 3: Input the element in array.

Step 4: Convert the given array of elements into a binary tree.

Step 5: Ensure that the tree is a max heap.

Step 6: Check every non-leaf node contains <= value element than its child nodes.

Step 7: If there exists any node that does not satisfy the ordering property of max heap,

Step 8: Swap the elements.

Step 9: Start checking from a non-leaf node with the highest index.

Step 10: Display the result.

Step 11: Stop
