Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a 1D array lis[] of size N.

Step 3: Take input from user

Step 4: Iterate for each element from index 1 to N-1.

Step 5: Iterate elements with indexes lesser than current element in a nested loop

Step 6: In the nested loop, if the elementâ€™s value is less than the current element

Step 7: Assign lis[i] with (lis[j]+1) 

Step 8: If (lis[j]+1) is greater than lis[i].

Step 9: Traverse the entire lis[] array to extract the maximum element.

Step 10: Display the total number of extract element.

Step 11: Stop
