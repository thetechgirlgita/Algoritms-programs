Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare and initialize a two-dimensional array a.

Step 3: Calculate the number of rows and columns present in the matrix 

Step 4: Store it in  variables rows and cols respectively.

Step 5: Declare another array t with reversed dimensions i.e t[cols][rows]. Array t will be         used to store the elements of the transposed matrix.

Step 6: Loop through the array a and convert its rows into columns of matrix t using
        t[ i ][ j ] = a[ j ][ i ];

Step 7:  Print the elements of matrix t.

Step 8: Stop
