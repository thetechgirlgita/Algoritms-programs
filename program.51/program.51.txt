 Step 1: Start
 
 Step 2: Input the array.
 
 Step 3: Find the midpoint of the sorted array.
 
 Step 4: Compare the midpoint to the value of interest.
 
 Step 5: If the midpoint is larger than the value,
    5.1: Perform binary search on right half of the array.
    
 Step 6: If the midpoint is smaller than the value,
    6.1: Perform binary search on left half of the array.
    
 Step 7: Repeat these steps until the midpoint value is equal to the value of interest or we know          the value is not in the array.
 
 Step 8: Stop
