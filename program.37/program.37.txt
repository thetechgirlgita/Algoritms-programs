Step 1: Start

Step 2: Read number num

Step 3: Initialize
r=1
Step 4: Repeat step 4 through 10 until num>=r

Step 5: Initialize
c=1
Step 6: Repeat step 6 through 8 until c<=r

Step 7: print */#

Step 8: c=c+1
[end of loop step6]

Step 9: go to next line

Step 10: r = r + 1
[end of loop step4]
Step 11: stop
