Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable to store array.

Step 3: Input values in array from user.

Step 4: Consider the first element of the list as pivot 
         (pivot element is the element which you pick to sort.
         You can pick random element from array as a pivot).
         
Step 5: Define two variables i and j.

Step 6: Set i and j to first and last elements of the list respectively.

Step 7: Increment i until list[i] > pivot then stop.

Step 8: Decrement j until list[j] < pivot then stop.

Step 9: If i < j then exchange list[i] and list[j].

Step 10: Repeat steps 7, 8 & 9 until i > j.

Step 11: Exchange the pivot element with list[j] element.

Step 12: Stop
