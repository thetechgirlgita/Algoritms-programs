Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Declare a variable to store an array.

Step 3: Input the elements in array.

Step 4: Convert the array into binary tree.

Step 5: If tree is empty then height of tree is 0.

Step 6: else Start from the root and ,

Step 7: Find the maximum depth of left sub-tree recursively.

Step 8: Find the maximum depth of right sub-tree recursively.

Step 9: Compare the depth of (left and right subtree) .

Step 10: If left subtree is greater then right subtree then.

Step 11: Print the value of left subtree as the height of Tree.

Step 12: If right subtree is greater then left subtree then.

Step 13: Print the value of right subtree as the height of Tree.

Step 14: Stop.
