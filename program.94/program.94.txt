Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Declare a variable to store an array.

Step 3: Input the elements in array.

Step 4: Convert the array into binary tree.

Step 5: Check if the root node is NUll, and if it is so, the output will be 0.

Step 6: Calculate the height of the left subtree.

Step 7: Calculate height of the right subtree.

Step 8: If the diameter of the tree passes through the root node,then

Step 9: Diamter = Height in Step (6) + Height in Step (7) + 1.

Step 10: Diameter of the tree considering only the left subtree of the current root node is calculated.

Step 11: Diamter of the tree considering only right subtree of the current root node is calculated.

Step 12: The maximum of the values in Step (9), Step (10), Step (11) is given as output.

Step 13: Stop.
