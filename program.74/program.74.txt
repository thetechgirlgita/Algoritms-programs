Step 1: Start

Step 2: Declare a variable to  store a list.

Step 3: Take input from user.

Step 4: Create 3 nodes, curr, Prev and next.

Step 5: Initialize them as curr = head, next = null, prev = null

Step 6: Now keep reversing the pointers one by one till curr != null

Step 7: During this process (curr != null) nodes will assign as 

   7.1: next = curr.next
   7.2: curr.next = prev
   7.3: prev = curr
   7.4: curr = next
   
Step 8: Print the reversed list.

Step 9: Stop
