 Step 1: Start
 
 Step 2: Declare variables "i", "a","b" , "show"
 
 Step 3: Initialize the variables, a = 0, b = 1, and show = 0
 
 Step 4: Enter the number of terms of Fibonacci series to be printed
 
 Step 5: Print First two terms of series
 
 Step 6: Use loop for the following steps
 
 Step 6.1: show = a+b
 
 Step 6.2: a = b
 
 Step 6.3: b = show
 
 Step 6.4: increase value of i each time by 1
 
 Step 6.5: print the value of show
 
 Step 7:   End
